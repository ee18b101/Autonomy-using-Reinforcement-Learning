# Achieving Autonomy using Reinforcement Learning

In this project, **Deep Q-Learning** is used to train a model to try and drive on it's own inside the **CARLA Simulator**. This project was inspired by Sentdex's videos on CARLA. The car here has only one sensor - a camera attached to the front. The Deep Q-Learning model tries to drive on it's own using only this camera input. Here is one such result:
